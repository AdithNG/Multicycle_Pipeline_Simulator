If string - create object

Object 

If source register is the same as one of the busy registers - Hazard, stall


Instruction.stall = true         -> This means that the instruction will stall, this means that also the previous instruction in the IF stage must stall in IF
Instruction.stall = false        -> This means you can move this to the execution stage in the next cycle, and move the next instruction to the ID stage

Instruction.forwarding1 = true/false    
Instruction.forwarding2 = true/false
-> These will be flagged true if the source registers are found in the forwarding dictionary

Instruction.forwardSource1 = value
Instruction.forwardSource2 = value
-> These will hold the values forwarded so it can start executing before entering the memory stage
